For our group project, we are choosing to analyze datasets about racial/gender distribution, representation, and inequity in various settings. Our frst dataset, racial distribution at the Oscars, presents data collected on the racial distribution and discrimination in the Oscars. Our second dataset addresses racial distribution and enrollment on the UW Seattle campus. Our third dataset explores U.S. incomes by gender and occupation. We found these three datasets because we want to explore gender or racial data in America, and chose three different but similar datasets to help us explore what kind of dataset we might want to commit to analyzing. These three datasets, while collected in differing settings, all relate to gender and/or racial inequality.

By exploring these datasets and choosing which one we would like to commit to, we hope to resolve questions surrounding racial inequality and/or gender inequality. We would like to know how gender and/or racial inequality manifests in a given setting, such as occupations, college campuses, or a historic American institution such as the Oscars. We want to understand how gender and race play a role in representation in America.
